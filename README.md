A calculator used to determine a DVR's time offset

## Description

Built with Javascript. A little application that I built to assist with collection of video for my work as a crime scene investigator. 

If you have ever worked retail, you know that for some reason, making change and doing simple mathematic operations can be a nightmare when trying to push through a line of impatient customers. Video collection (exporting video from the CCTV of residences or businesses) comes with a similar issue; time discrepancies. Very seldom are the system times of a CCTV system accurate to real time. For instance, if a crime occurs at 3:30 in the morning and it is two hours slower than actual time. You're going to spend a lot of time trying to find the video that you need if you don't know the time offset. Usually, the math can be done in your head, but some days after a long shift, simple math isn't so simple and the last thing you want to do is make a mistake. 

This is where my calculator comes into play. Enter the current time of your CCTV system and the actual time and it will output your time discrepancy.
